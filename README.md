## 🚀 About the Extension

**Real-Time Conflict Predictor** is a proactive VS Code extension designed to help developers detect potential merge conflicts before they happen. By integrating with GitHub, it analyzes changes in the master branch and open Pull Requests in real-time, warning you of potential conflicts while you code.

### Key Features

- **GitHub Integration:** Scans open PRs and remote branches for conflicting changes.
- **Visual Alerts:** Clear indicators in the status bar, tree view, and editor gutter.
- **Automatic Analysis:** Runs in the background to keep your conflict status up to date.

This landing page is built with a focus on performance, aesthetics, and user experience.

- **Modern UI/UX:** Designed with a clean, modern aesthetic using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Interactive Preview:** Features a simulated VS Code window demonstrating the extension's functionality.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Fully responsive dark/light theme toggle that respects system preferences.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Built-in support for multiple languages (currently English and Turkish).
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for all device sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Smooth Animations:** Engaging scroll and fade-in animations for a polished feel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The project is built using standard web technologies without heavy framework dependencies:

- **HTML5:** Semantic markup structure.
